[/ This is an example of a simple .boxconfig file! /]

[/ Here we tell the compiler where to find our definitions: /]
[Definitions]
  root = definition
  suffix = d 

[/ ... and here we set up two "compile" tasks: /]
[Compile]
  [/ All paths are relative to the .boxconfig file: /]
  source = src
  destination = www
  generator = html
  [/ We can limit this task to just files of the `doc` type: /]
  filter = doc

[Compile]
  source = src
  destination = markdown
  generator = md
  filter = doc

[/
  If we run the boxup cli in the `docs` folder, it will load the 
  definitions from the given folder, then attempt to run the `Compile`
  tasks.
