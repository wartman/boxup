        <h2>Blocks</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Blocks are what everything in Boxup are built out of. A block is simple: it consists of a block header -- a block name and (potentially) properties inside square brackets (e.g. <code>[foo bar=bin]</code> or just <code>[foo]</code>) -- and block children, which may be properties, text, other blocks or a combination of all of these.</p>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Comments are written like this: <code>[/ Comment /]</code>. They can come anywhere in a Boxup document. They <i>should</i> be nest-able soon too (although they aren't quite yet). </p>

        <h2>Multiline Strings</h2>
      </header>
      <p>Multiline strings start and end with the pipe (<code>|</code>) operator. All strings can technically span several lines, but this special syntax strips whitespace from the start of each line of the string up to the index where the <b>first non-whitespace character was encountered</b>.</p>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre class="code code--boxup">
        
        [SomeBlock]
          foo = |
            This is where indentation starts.
              Thus, When rendered, this line will only have two spaces
              in front of it!
            
            Also, any whitespace after the first \| will be ignored,
            and any whitespace before the last \| will be skipped.
    
            Also note that you need to escape pipes in these examples.
