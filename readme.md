[boxup]
=======

Structured markup.

Example
-------

Here's an example of a simple Boxup document: 

```boxup

[/ Comments look like this! /]

[Article]
  title = Hello world!
  slug = hello_world

[Section/one]
  [Header] Hello!

  Boxup is a very simple markup language based around square brackets
  and indentation. What sets it apart is that it is typed and uses
  definition files to validate your markup.

```

Docs
----

Documentation is currently a work in progress.

You'll be able to find it [here](docs/markdown/index.md) soon. For now, you can take a look in the [docs](docs) or the [example](example) folders to start getting a sense of how things work.
