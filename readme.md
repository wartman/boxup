BOXUP
=====

Typed markup for Haxe.

Example
-------

```code boxup

[Article]
  title = Hello world!
  slug = hello_world

[Section id = one]
  [Header] Hello!

  Boxup is a very simple markup language based around square brackets
  and indentation. What's more, every block in this file -- that is,
  every section that starts with \[$name] -- is defined in a Haxe
  class, meaning your markup can be checked as you write!

  This doesn't quite work yet, but you can look in the
  <test>[Link url ='test'] folder for some early examples of how this
  looks.

```
