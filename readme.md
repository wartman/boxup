[Article]
  title = Hello world!
  slug = hello_world

[Section id = one]
  [Header] Hello!

  Boxup is a very simple markup language based around square brackets
  and indentation. It even has the starts of a way to type-check your markup!

  This doesn't quite work yet, but you can look in the
  <test>[Link url ='test'] folder for some early examples of how this
  looks.

```
